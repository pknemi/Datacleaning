# Datacleaning,outlier detection and visualization.
In this task, we'll perform data cleaning, outlier detection, and visualization 
on a car prices dataset using pandas. The dataset includes columns such as Selling Price,
Market Price, Model, Odometer, Condition, and other attributes related to various car brands.
The goal is to ensure data quality by identifying and handling missing values, detecting outliers 
in key numerical fields like price and odometer readings, and visualizing patterns and distributions 
to gain insights into the factors affecting car prices.
